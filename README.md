# Tern Travel Plugin

This plugin for the Tern Travel CRM/Itinerary software platform enhances the user experience by automatically summarizing and displaying key information about trips and tasks. It dynamically updates the task summary section with counts of tasks due within specific time frames and provides a visual summary of the number of trips in different statuses. This helps users quickly understand their workload and prioritize tasks effectively.
